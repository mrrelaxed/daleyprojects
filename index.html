Hi, I want to be able to get a background image go down to the bottom of the browser window, even when there isn't any content on the page.
I want the background image to behave exactly as the one here does: http://robcubbon.com/dev/ongala/home-6.html458 – the height of the image is 100% the height of the browser window and the width covers the 100% of the browser window and crops off the sides if necessary.
I have tried to recreate this here: http://ongala.co.uk/98 and have copied the CSS line for line (I think) but I can't get the same covering
